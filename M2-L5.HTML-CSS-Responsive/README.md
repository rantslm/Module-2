# M2-L5: Build a Responsive Webpage

In this lab, you will add `media queries` to the resume webpage you created in the previous lab to make it responsive. ðŸ“±

Use the device toolbar in your browser's **Developer Tools Inspector** to emulate smaller devices like phones. Your goal is to adjust the CSS so the website looks good on all screen sizes and doesnâ€™t require horizontal scrolling.

You may need to consider:

- Changing the `font-size` for smaller screens
- Changing the `flex-direction` from `row` to `column`
- Adjusting other `flexbox` parameters and text alignment

For example, your final responsive website might look something like this on a mobile device:
